title: "A Formalism for the Lorentz Transform"
date: "2016-09-07"
category: "Physics"
tags: [special relativity, inertial frames, lorentz transform]
summary: "I derive a systematic way of writing down the set of equations that define the Lorentz transform for two inertial frames of reference with a relative velocity between them. This is going to make life a lot easier for future derivations."
