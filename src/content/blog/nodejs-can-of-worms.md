title: "NodeJS - A Can of Worms"
date: "2022-07-02"
category: "Web Development"
tags: [reactjs, nodejs, backend]
summary: "I've found NodeJS to be very useful - in fact, it seems to be the industry standard when it comes to library management, server management and app deployment. It's something that I found out about only after learning React for a while, so I think it's worth writing a post on."
