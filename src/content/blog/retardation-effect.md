title: "The Retardation Effect: Images of Fast Moving Objects"
date: "2016-09-06"
category: "Physics"
tags: [special relativity, retardation effect, inertial frames]
summary: "I write about the transition lag between an object's light signal from the time it is emitted to when it reaches the human eye. I wrote this article as an outlet when my father was suffering from cancer, as were many posts written during this period of time. This article never got completed, but I don't intend to finish it anyway. In some sense, I never received complete closure of my dad's passing, and this blog post is a good reminder of my grief."
