title: "Making the Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics"
date: "2024-09-20"
category: "Physics"
tags: [quantum field theory, classical mechanics, lagrangian, hamiltonian, poisson bracket]
summary: "In beginner quantum mechanics, we sling the Schr√∂dinger wave equation around quite recklessly, imbibing the gospel of the Hamiltonian. But where does the great Hamiltonian come from, and can we figure out an elegant transition from classical to quantum mechanical frameworks?"
